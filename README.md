<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/loRFgCHN1X0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


## Overview

This Chrome extension allows users to record their screen or specific windows using Manifest V3. It provides a solution to the problem where screen recording is not possible using the new offscreen API in Manifest V3, and previous methods of screen recording, such as `chrome.desktopCapture.chooseDesktopMedia()`, no longer work in Manifest V3.

Developed by [CodedBrainy.com](https://www.codedbrainy.com).

## Features

- Record your entire screen or specific application windows.
- Save recorded sessions as video files.
- Easy-to-use interface for screen recording.
- Compatible with Chrome's Manifest V3 extension framework.
